              Tracking issues are used to record the overall progress of development.
              They are also used as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.
              A tracking issue is however not meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature.
              Instead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature label.

              Include each step required to complete the feature. Typically this is a PR
              implementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However
              for larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.
