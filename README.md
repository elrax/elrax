Elrax is an **open-source video platform** for **crowdfunding, progress tracking, and feedback collection**. Through it, we want to make a powerful push for crowdfunding to become even more popular in the world.

We aim to create an application that will become standard for users on a par with YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. But unlike them, we will promote our **"Don't just watch, but participate"** approach. Each visit, whether short or long, will count and give users the feeling that they are part of something bigger, something important to them, society, or nature.
